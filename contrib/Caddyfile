#This is the Caddy Config we use on NixOrigin.one

# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.
#
#
#Redirect IP to Domain
:80 { 
	redir https://nixorigin.one 
	}

#
nixorigin.one, www.nixorigin.one {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	root * /var/www/html/public

	header { 
		X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" 		
		X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" 		
		X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
		Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
		Referrer-Policy "same-origin"	
		
		
	} 

	
	php_fastcgi unix//run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock
	# Enable the static file server.
	file_server

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
